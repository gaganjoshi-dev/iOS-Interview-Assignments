 This is the second question , Time given was 15 - 20 min.
 Was easy , but not able to do that, I should have focus more on image provided.
 
 
 Task Description
 A machine can cut a rectangular board in pieces of different sizes.
 
 Its input is:
 s - the size of the board to be cut, in the form "width,height"
 x - an array of coordinates for vertical cuts
 y - an array of coordinates for horizontal cuts
 
 Here are some examples of inputs and the resulting cuts: check image in resources
 
 Write a function getLargestPiece(s, x, y) that returns the area of the largest piece produced by the cutting machine after all the cuts are made.
 
 Note: We will assume that the cut width is negligible.
 
 Test Cases:
 getLargestPiece("9,9", [3,6], [3,6]) // 9
 getLargestPiece("10,10", [8,2], [2,8]) // 36
 getLargestPiece("10,10", [3], []) // 70
 getLargestPiece("10,10", [], []) // 100
 getLargestPiece("100,70", [25], []) // 5250
 getLargestPiece("100,70", [], [35]) // 3500
 getLargestPiece("100,70", [50], []) // 3500
 getLargestPiece("100,70", [80,20], [35]) // 2100
