Starter contains the assignment I was given in the interview. They gave me options to choose from UIKit or SwiftUI projects, and I chose UIKit.

Total Time Frame for all tasks: one hour.

You are required to complete each task properly within the one-hour timeframe, progressing to the next task upon completion. Explaining your thought process or alternative ways of solving the problems would also help. They are quite interested in clean and scalable code.

Tasks:

Parse the data in the view model's retrieveEvents function.
Implement a search bar filter by city.
Sort by price, with both filters applicable individually or in union.
Additional tasks:

Add another filter to select the cheapest event.
Answer questions regarding scalable code, explaining how to quickly add any number of filters beyond just city and cheapest events.
Key points to remember:

Creating and explaining scalable code is paramount.
Optimizations:

Add filters for text-searching events by city and a checkbox to "show only the cheapest of the search result."
Make the filters generic to facilitate adding more filters, which holds significant importance.
Fetch events from a mock API instead of a JSON file.
